# Model card: release candidate-2957657610

Written from the evidence this pipeline recorded. Each value below is copied from the manifest, the Witness decision, the signature record or the deployment receipt; "not recorded" means the record does not say.

## Purpose

A model checked by the release gate under policy credit-demo-v1. The evidence does not state a business purpose, so none is claimed here.

## What was released

- Pipeline: 2957657610, commit 3e11714dfbfb3e6ad8b7b545ea29e208094eb306
- Model file SHA-256: `e0c256545cbde8964bf9674b9e36695ff32cbb06a3328490c96a9f79bc7a207d`
- Image: `registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-ai-hackathon/transcend-october-2026/43241733/gasket/release:3e11714d-d-p2957657610`, digest `sha256:26a03e0783e6541fd6d8cfcfe3db57b4ddab7d0f3eaa9c288f57b412df2a0b4d`

## Data

- Evaluation data: `data/evaluation.csv`, SHA-256 `bb9fd32de35231837283918f10bb7030f41476c39a381cde46405fb0f3615998`
- The evaluation data is the fixed holdout; its hash is bound into the evidence, so a different file is a different release.

## Metrics against the policy

Policy `credit-demo-v1`, file SHA-256 `ae1fd5794425eb329c478489cd13ca7d74268abd303c9308008e01ed0d0325e3`.

| Measure | Value | Limit | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 0.7425 | at least 0.72 | within policy |
| Fairness gap (equal_opportunity_difference) | 0.0085 | at most 0.05 | within policy |

True-positive rate by group: group 0: 0.8468, group 1: 0.8383.

## Decision

The Witness decision was **pass**.

## Signer and release

- Evidence signed: no or not recorded
- Signer identity: not recorded
- Verify: `not recorded`
- Approved by: @chandran.sivasurya
- Release job started by: not recorded

## Known limits

- The data is synthetic and the thresholds are this project's own demonstration rule, not a legal or regulatory standard.
- Fairness is measured with one metric (equal opportunity difference) between two groups; it says nothing about other groups or measures.
- The signature proves the evidence came from this pipeline and is unaltered. It does not assert that a person reviewed its correctness.
